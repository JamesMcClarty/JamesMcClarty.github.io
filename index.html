            <p>The love of video games when I was a small lad drove me into fascination with computer science.
                In my college years, I had taken courses into game development, but found that the process
                of creating applications, not just video games, was also engaging, educating, and fun. So, I'm
                working to expand my portfolio and skill set to fit whatever needs come to mind, whether it's my own or
                others'.
